Ideas:
  - Diabetes proteins
    - Insulin pathways
  - Mutations and cancerogenesis
  
Look at Wikidata and what content is already registered in terms of various proteins.

We have found upregulated proteins and downregulated proteins in connection with the cellular senescence in humans in Wikidata.
We can visualize these two groups based on their locations in cell. The proteins will be listed with a drop down menu or tree chart.
