Ideas:
  - Diabetes proteins
    - Insulin pathways
  - Mutations and cancerogenesis
  
Look at Wikidata and what content is already registered in terms of various proteins.

CELLULAR SENSESCENCE PROTEINS FROM AMIGO:

CELLULAR SENESCENCE PROTEINS FROM UNIPROT:

We have found proteins related to positive and negative regulation of senescence in humans in Wikidata.
We can visualize these two groups in bubbles, and maybe an extra bubble that would contain the labelled images of these proteins.
Not all the proteins may have images though.
